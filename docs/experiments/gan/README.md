# Gan S0 Experiment Map

Status: active guidance
Last updated: 2026-05-28 after G6 evaluation-surface decision

## Current Question

Gan S0 is now a decomposition problem, not a generic prompt-improvement track.

The system must separate:

1. frequency-content gate;
2. candidate inventory;
3. temporal anchoring;
4. scope and benchmark target selection;
5. canonical label construction and aggregation;
6. unknown versus no-reference policy;
7. evidence and schema validation.

## Current Baselines

| Surface | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Builder-gap v1 GPT | promoted baseline / synthetic operational default | 80.6% monthly canonical validation; 79.9% monthly under `gan2026_paper_reproduction` in G5. |
| Builder-gap v1 Qwen | accepted local transfer | 70.7% monthly canonical validation; 70.2% monthly under `gan2026_paper_reproduction`; not hosted parity. |
| D1 v1.2b schema guard only | mechanism baseline | 79.9% monthly canonical validation; 76.6% monthly under `gan2026_paper_reproduction`; best current structured date/event payload baseline. |
| R1.1 schema guard Qwen | held diagnostic | 71.3% monthly, 93.3% schema validity; held after R10, not promoted. |

- `gan_s0_candidate_inventory_coverage_report_20260528.md` - G1 no-model candidate inventory coverage by label family and hard stratum.
- `gan_s0_target_label_split_g2_report_20260528.md` - G2 ablation plan plus no-model target-selection/label-construction split scaffold.

- `gan_s0_g4_explicit_reason_code_adjudicator_report_20260528.md` - G4 explicit reason-code adjudicator result; traceability worked, but the tested arm did not promote because it chose seizure-free candidates over quantified candidates on five enriched-slice records.

- `gan_s0_g6_evaluation_slice_standard_decision_20260528.md` - G6 decision: use a locked 50-record mechanism slice plus named challenge sets; keep the old 25-record enriched slice as smoke-only.

- `gan_s0_r13_self_consistency_variance_probe_decision_20260528.md` - self-consistency rejected arm.
- `gan_s0_r14_gepa_failure_postmortem_qwen_gate_design_20260528.md` - optimizer gate.
- `../../datasets/gan/gan_2026_label_audit.md` - gold and scorer policy.

## Do Not Treat As Active Guidance

Older files about temporal candidates, verify-repair, expanded builders, prompt
policy, GEPA, retrieval, and targeted examples are evidence. They prevent
repeating failed arms, but they no longer define the research program unless
listed above or in `../../component_ceiling_registry.md`.

## Active Next Work

1. Use G6 before any new selector or adjudicator run: the old enriched
   25-record slice is smoke-only, `gan_s0_g6_standard50_v1` is the default
   mechanism-comparison surface, and named challenge sets are diagnostic
   overlays.
2. Use the G4 negative result and G5 scorer-mode forensics before trying any
   new seizure-free, quantified-rate, unknown, or no-reference selector.
3. Decide whether the seeded reason-code/answer-options selector surrogate
   deserves a full-validation confirmation only through a G6-aligned protocol;
   G4 as tested is a negative traceability result, not a promotion path.
4. Keep arithmetic and broad relative-anchor guardrails diagnostic-only until a
   seizure-specific parser exists.
5. Use the G5 rescore pack for synthetic-only paper-facing tables; Real(300)
   and Real(150) benchmark reporting remains blocked.

## Filing Guidance

New Gan docs should state which decomposition component they touch and whether
their decision scope is `arm`, `mechanism`, `operational`, `diagnostic`, or
`blocked`.
